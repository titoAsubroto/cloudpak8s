This is a good assumption in general when deploying Cloud Paks to Openshift; that you should not need to SSH into any cluster nodes and you will perform Cloud Pak installation from another node outside of the cluster.\n\nNote that in RHOKS, the internal Openshift image registry is not exposed by default (the registry route is not created).  As the registry volume is also not sized very large, it is recommended to use [IBM Container Registry](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry) for any large image storage such as Cloud Pak image storage.  The internal Openshift image registry should mostly be used for S2I and as a local image cache.\n\nAnother caveat when using RHOKS is that all cluster users must be in IBM Cloud IAM.  At this time, Cloud Paks require a cluster-admin user, which means the user installing the Cloud Pak must be a super user of the cluster.
