Log into your IBM Cloud Account.  From the Dashboard on the Search Bar, \nenter in `Cloud Pak for Integration`.  It will take you to the section \nwhere you can create your own cluster.\n\n7.

For example the 0000 before .us-south is \nwrong in the following URL. Instead the 0000 needs replaced with 0001:\n\nIncorrect URL: https://integration-integration.drm-cp4i-cluster-bd61e41b2ca9182e95120f4f372e19d6-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/\n\nCorrect URL: https://integration-integration.drm-cp4i-cluster-bd61e41b2ca9182e95120f4f372e19d6-0001.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/\n\nTo delete an old workspace instance, in the IBM Cloud navigate to \n`Schematics->Workspaces` and delete the old workspace.
