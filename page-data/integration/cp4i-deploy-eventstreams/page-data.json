Run the following\n    commands on each node:\n\n    ```\n    sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144\n\n    echo \"vm.max_map_count=262144\" | tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n    ```\n\nYou also may want to consider manually setting security if you run into\nissues related to permissions.  This applies to non-production/poc type\nenvironments where you need to get things up and running quickly.\nHere are the commands:\n\n```\noc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:eventstreams\noc adm policy add-scc-to-group ibm-anyuid-scc system:serviceaccounts:eventstreams\n```\nThis assumes you are installing to the eventstreams namespace/project.\nIf you are using a different location, adjust the last parameter to match\nyour environment.\n\n### Begin Installation\n1. Go to CP4I Platform Home. Click **Create instance** inside\nthe **Event Streams** tile.\n1. A window will pop up with a description of the requirements for\ninstalling. Click **Continue** to the helm chart deployment configuration.\n2. Click **Overview** to view the chart information and pre-reqs that\nwere covered in [Prepare Installation](#prepare-installation).\n3. Click **Configure**\n4. Enter the Helm release name. In our example, **es-1**\n5. Enter Target Namespace - **eventstreams**\n6. Select a Cluster - **local-cluster**.\n7. Check the license agreement.\n8. Under Parameter click **Quick Start** to expand.\n9. Here you will need to set the `Certificate Secret Name`.  Set this to a\nsimple value like `eventstreamssecret`.\n10. Image Pull Secret - Set to `ibm-entitlement-key` if using entitled\nregistry or if offline use the `deployer-dockercfg-XX` secret in your ace\nnamespace.  Use `oc get secrets` to get the exact value for your\nenvironment.\n11. Under `External Access Settings` find the `External hostname/IP address` and set that to the icp-proxy address defined during icp / common-services installation - icp-proxy.\\&lt;openshift-router-domain&gt;\n8. Under Parameters click **All Parameters** to expand.\n9. Under `Global install settings` ensure the `Generate Certificate for Security` checked.\n10.
