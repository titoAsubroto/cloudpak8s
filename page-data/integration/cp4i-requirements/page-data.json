Docker provides very intuitive instructions for installation.  The OC CLI code and installation instructions can be accessed [here from RedHat OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).\n\n## Workload Requirements\n\nGeneral cluster sizing guidance is provided lower down in this page.  Avoid installing minimal environments.  Keep in mind that an realistic cluster running the Cloud Pak for Integration will contain multiple workloads from the below chart.  Your cluster will likely host other Cloud Pak workload or be shared with other non-Cloud Pak workload.  Of course, licensing for Cloud Paks only covers the exact equivalent licenses for the underlying OCP.  You can find discussion from this section in the [Requirements Knowledge Center article](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_20.1/install/sysreqs.html) for the Cloud Pak for Integration.\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Integration Capability | CPU | Memory | Disk space |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Platform Navigator**:  The base product that will deploy as part of the installation | .25 cores | 256 Mb | Not Required |\n| **Common Services**:  Required by the base product.

Your persistent storage provider will depend largely on the cloud environment you are deploying to.  Each **public cloud** provider has their own storage services that can (and should) be used for your workload's persistent storage.  These providers will easily match to the requirements in the chart below.  Take time to understand fully each column.\n\nThere currently are more decisions to make when the solution is deployed into **private (on-premise) infrastructure**.  OpenShift now has the industry leading solution for providing container storage called Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (OCS).  See [this document](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.html) for a detailed explanation.  This solution is based upon Rook / Ceph and runs as an operator from within your cluster.  It can be used without license in your lower environments without support.  At the time of this article being written OCS licensing for support etc. **is not included with Cloud Pak licenses** and must be purchased separately.  IBM Storage also has a hardware / software available for purchase to provide first-class persistent storage to your private cloud stateful containers.  Outside of these solutions using your enterprise NFS provides a decent option for providing **File** storage and Rook / Ceph provide adequate support for most **Block Storage** requirements.  For production workloads please consider the resilience of the persistent storage provider you chose.  In the near future OCS will be the preferred solution for production workload that require resilient on-premise storage.\n\nWith this guidance in mind, use the following table to help make your persistent storage decisions and create the required [storage classes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html) prior to deployment.\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Integration Capability | Storage Type | Access Mode | Performance |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Platform Navigator**: Not persistent storage required | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| **Common Services**:  Configured as part of Cloud Pak base installation | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommended 10 IOPS/GB |\n| **API Lifecycle and Management** | Block | RWO | Minimum 4 IOPS/GB Recommend 10 IOPS/GB |\n| **Queue Manager** | File | RWX | [Affected by other limits applied to the file system](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/testing-statement-ibm-mq-multi-instance-queue-manager-file-systems) |\n| **Event Messaging**: See the [IBM Event Streams storage documentation](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fibm.github.io%2Fevent-streams%2Finstalling%2Fprerequisites%2F%23file-systems-for-storage) | File/Block | RWO | [Notes](https://www.ibm.com/links?url=https%3A%2F%2Fibm.github.io%2Fevent-streams%2Finstalling%2Fprerequisites%2F%23file-systems-for-storage) |\n| **Application Integration**: When deployed without including MQ capability no persistent volume is required.

Do not consider your choices for today to be the best decision for long term.  It is likely that improved options will make themselves available.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## OCP Cluster Configuration Best-Practices\n\nThis playbook contains a section that offers general OpenShift Cloud Platform configuration and installation procedures.  For environments that require resilience, the below is the best practice recommendation for hosting Cloud Pak for Integration on OCP 4.2 or 4.3.  You can configure smaller environments, but this is the getting-started suggestion.  Also, this cluster has a large enough control plane to grow in order to support a larger number of compute nodes for hosting additional workload.\n\n<!-- <style>\ntable {\n  padding: 0; }\n  table tr {\n    border-top: 1px solid #cccccc;\n    background-color: white;\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0; }\n    table tr:nth-child(2n) {\n      background-color: #f8f8f8; }\n    table tr th {\n      font-weight: bold;\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr td {\n      border: 1px solid #cccccc;\n      text-align: left;\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 6px 13px; }\n    table tr th :first-child, table tr td :first-child {\n      margin-top: 0; }\n    table tr th :last-child, table tr td :last-child {\n      margin-bottom: 0; }\n</style>\n<style>\n.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {\n        border: 1px solid black;\n        }\n</style -->\n| Node | Nodes | vCPU | RAM | Storage |\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **Control Plane Nodes (Masters)** | 3 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 300 GB |\n| **Compute Nodes (Workers)** | 5 | 8 vCPU | 32 GB | 200 GB |\n| **Compute & Storage Nodes**: For use on primarily on-premise cluster to host OCS or Rook / Ceph storage.
